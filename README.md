# DSA Solutions

This repository contains a collection of my solutions to various Data Structures and Algorithms problems from platforms like LeetCode, Codeforces, and others.

**Total Solutions: 102**

## How to Use

The repository is organized into two main parts: Core Algorithm Implementations and Problem Solutions.

## Core Algorithm Implementations

Separate from the problem solutions, this repository includes a `Core_Algorithms` directory containing clean, focused implementations of fundamental data structures and algorithms. These files are not tied to a specific problem from an online judge, but rather serve as educational reference code. They are intended to provide a clear, practical understanding of how these core concepts work internally.

## Problem Solutions

The `solutions` directory contains solutions to specific problems, organized by topic.

### Categorization Strategy

To maintain a clean and predictable structure, this repository follows an **"Algorithm-First"** categorization rule for problem solutions:

1.  **Prioritize Algorithmic Technique:** If a solution is a direct application of a major algorithmic paradigm (e.g., Dynamic Programming, Recursion, Binary Search), it is placed in the folder for that technique. This is done to showcase the application of these core patterns.
    *   *Example:* A number theory problem solved with binary search will be in `solutions/Searching`.

2.  **Fall back to Problem Domain:** If the solution does not use a major, named algorithmic technique as its core, it is categorized by its primary data structure or problem domain (e.g., `ArraysAndStrings`, `Graphs`, `MathAndNumberTheory`).
