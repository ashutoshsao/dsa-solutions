# DSA Solutions

**Total Solutions: 85**

This repository contains a collection of my solutions to various Data Structures and Algorithms problems from platforms like LeetCode, Codeforces, and others.

## How to Use

The solutions are organized into directories based on their primary topic. Each file contains the source code for a specific problem.

## Categorization Strategy

To maintain a clean and predictable structure, this repository follows an **"Algorithm-First"** categorization rule:

1.  **Prioritize Algorithmic Technique:** If a solution is a direct application of a major algorithmic paradigm (e.g., Dynamic Programming, Recursion, Binary Search), it is placed in the folder for that technique. This is done to showcase the application of these core patterns.
    *   *Example:* A number theory problem solved with binary search will be in `solutions/Searching`.

2.  **Fall back to Problem Domain:** If the solution does not use a major, named algorithmic technique as its core, it is categorized by its primary data structure or problem domain (e.g., `ArraysAndStrings`, `Graphs`, `MathAndNumberTheory`).
